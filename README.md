DEMO

A demo of this Frontend is located at: https://vue-demo.daniel-avellaneda.com

Login credentials

email: admin@admin.com

password: 12345

IMPORTANT: Database resets every 30 mins like "12:00am, 12:30am, 1:00am" and so on. So anything you do will be lost after a short time.

Demo is also linked to a Node.js express.js MongoDB JWT REST API project that shows how this frontend can be integrated to an API.

Running demo is here: https://api-demo.daniel-avellaneda.com

Chai Assertion Library is used for tests
